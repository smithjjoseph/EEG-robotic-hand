# Report Notes

## Test Videos

### Design Choices

- hand uses both colour and shape as it accommodates for individuals who are colourblind as well those who may have a visual perception deficits
- SVG and jQuery used as this allows the tests to loop, they can be played on any modern browser, and it allows for a high degree of parameterisability

### Limitations

- The test videos are most effective on 16:9 aspect ratio displays as the SVG is designed on a 1920x1080 canvas
