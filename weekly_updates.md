# Weekly Updates:

All students are required to send a weekly report via email describing,  briefly, the progress made during that period. It should include:

- **A list of supervision meetings** that have occurred since the last update
- A brief description of **progress on actions** from the last update
- **Other progress** on the project since the last update
- **Objectives** to complete before the next update - these should be measurable, e.g.
  - Order specific components (so should be ordered by next update)
  - Install software package (so should be installed by next update)
  - Update literature review (typically an ongoing task but some progress should be measurable and reported)
- **Comments** on any other aspects of the project
  - E.g. supervision, facilities, work environment, outside interest in the project
- Details of any **concerns** regarding the project

The report should be sent via email to Adar (who will respond with feedback) and copied to Jihong & [engineering-project-updates@york.ac.uk](mailto:engineering-project-updates@york.ac.uk)

# 23rd February

**Supervision Meetings:**

- No supervision meetings

**Progress on Actions:**

- First update, no previous objectives

**Other Progress:**

- Visited LIVE lab on Monday to have a look at EEG
  - Jack informed me that it was incorrectly setup so we didn't manage to do anything with it
  - Revisiting on Wednesday when Ellie should be available to show us how to use it
- Just received a USB drive for OS installation

**Objectives for Next Update:**

- Partition drive on laptop, install Ubuntu and ROS
- Create project code repository for version control and backup purposes
- Create visual stimuli for collecting EEG data
  - Will use movie.py for this to create configurable test videos
- Work on initial report

**Questions I have:**

- Should I be setting up weekly meetings with Jihong?
  - Is there guidance for the contents of these meetings?
- I realise the LIVE lab is usually locked - who should I ask if I want to access the lab? 
- Are there rules pertaining to linking a Git repository to Github
  - Is this allowed at all
  - If allowed, does it for example have to be set to private or can it be public?

**Questions/Concerns:**

- On documents should I use the full original name of the project: 'Robotic Hand Control using EEGs/EMGs' or am I free to instead use an adjusted name: 'Robotic Hand Control using EEG'?
- Am I required to fill in an ethics form for this project? I do have a human subject (myself) 



*Laptop was already setup with Windows. Wanted to dual-boot. Shrunk Windows partition. Disabled secure boot. Tried Ubuntu installation. Notified that storage controller needed changing (Intel RST to AHCI). Needed to make registry edits and change storage controller in BIOS. Windows expectedly BSODed. Boot files were corrupted so they had to be remade from recovery files. Tried all solutions on Ubuntu website. Tried some of my own solutions. Windows recovery partition also corrupted making it unusable without new installation media. Ended up formatting drive and just installing Ubuntu on a fresh drive.
